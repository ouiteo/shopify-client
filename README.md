# Shopify client

A heavily modified version of https://github.com/gnikyt/shopify_client stripped back to support only async graphql
queries, with some additional functionality added in, namely:

- bulk job handling
- auto-pagination

Use at your own risk, as we are currently developing this package for our own use and it is not yet stable.
